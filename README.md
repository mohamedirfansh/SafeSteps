# SafeSteps

## üìñ Overview
- 23.8% of Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above by 2030
- More than 1 in 4 elderly experiences a fall annually
- Falls are especially dangerous for the elderly
- Timely assistance could prevent the exacerbation of injuries
- It would be useful to see who is more prone to falls

## üí° What it does
- SafeSteps is a wearable IoT device that can be strapped to the arm
- Detects when the wearer falls
- Immediately sends a Telegram message to family member alerting them
- Also displays falls in a dashboard to see if elderly are very prone to falling, thus requiring more care
- Allows doctors/nurses to also monitor all patients under their care

## üõ†Ô∏è How it was built
- We used edge-computing to perform computation on a low-performant device using embedded-C.
- We used an Arduino board and used Tensorflow-lite to deploy a Machine Learning model in it.
- Fall detection is performed within the Arduino itself.
- We wrote python scripts to a RPi server. Arduino sends data to RPi through serial communication.
- RPi server is connected to the internet and calls updates the Firebase realtime database.
- RPi also calls the Telegram API to send text to the family member.
- Family members/doctors can monitor falls through a web client.
- They can see past history of falls to see if an elderly is more prone to falls, thus getting more attention.
- Web client was built using React, Typescript, Tailwindcss.
- When a fall occurs, the client get a push notification as well.
